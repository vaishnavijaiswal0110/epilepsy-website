<h2>3. Causes of Epilepsy</h2>

<p>
Epilepsy has many causes that disrupt the brain's normal electrical activity. These causes fall into several broad categories: genetic, structural, infectious, metabolic, immune, and unknown.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Genetic causes</strong> involve inherited or random mutations in genes that manage ion channels, neurotransmitters, or brain development. These mutations can make neurons overly excitable and more prone to seizures. In some cases, epilepsy runs in families, while in others, the mutation appears for the first time in the affected person.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Structural causes</strong> refer to physical damage or abnormalities in the brain. This includes head injuries from accidents, scars from past brain surgeries, tumors, cysts, or malformations of the cerebral cortex that occur before birth.
</p>

<p>
Problems during birth and early childhood, such as lack of oxygen during delivery, premature birth, low birth weight, neonatal infections, or brain hemorrhage, can cause permanent brain damage that may lead to epilepsy later in life.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Infectious causes</strong> come from diseases that inflame or damage brain tissue. Examples include meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscesses, malaria, or parasitic infections like neurocysticercosis.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Vascular causes</strong>, particularly strokes, brain hemorrhages, or abnormal blood vessels, are major causes of epilepsy in older adults because they disrupt blood flow and damage brain cells.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Metabolic and systemic disorders</strong>, such as low blood sugar, low sodium or calcium levels, severe liver or kidney failure, or inherited metabolic conditions, can trigger repeated seizures if the underlying problem continues.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Immune-related causes</strong>, such as autoimmune encephalitis, occur when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks brain tissue, causing inflammation and seizures.
</p>

<p>
Despite thorough medical evaluation, a significant number of epilepsy cases have no identifiable cause. These are classified as epilepsy of unknown cause, highlighting the complexity of the condition.
