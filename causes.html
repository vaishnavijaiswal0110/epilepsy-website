<h2>3. Causes of Epilepsy</h2>

<p>
Epilepsy has many causes that disrupt the brain's normal electrical activity. These causes fall into several broad categories: genetic, structural, infectious, metabolic, immune, and unknown.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Genetic causes</strong> involve inherited or random mutations in genes that manage ion channels, neurotransmitters, or brain development. These mutations can make neurons overly excitable and more prone to seizures.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Structural causes</strong> refer to physical damage or abnormalities in the brain such as head injuries, brain tumors, cysts, surgical scars, or developmental abnormalities before birth.
</p>

<p>
Problems during birth and early childhood, including lack of oxygen, premature birth, low birth weight, infections, or brain hemorrhage, can lead to epilepsy later in life.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Infectious causes</strong> include diseases such as meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscesses, malaria, and parasitic infections like neurocysticercosis.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Vascular causes</strong> such as strokes, brain hemorrhages, or abnormal blood vessels can disrupt blood flow and damage brain tissue.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Metabolic and systemic disorders</strong> like low blood sugar, electrolyte imbalance, liver or kidney failure, or inherited metabolic conditions can trigger seizures.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Immune-related causes</strong>, such as autoimmune encephalitis, occur when the immune system attacks brain tissue, causing inflammation and seizures.
</p>

<p>
In many cases, doctors cannot identify the exact cause. These cases are classified as epilepsy of unknown cause.
