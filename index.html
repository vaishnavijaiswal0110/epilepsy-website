<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder marked by a tendency to have recurring, unprovoked seizures. These seizures happen due to abnormal, excessive, or simultaneous electrical activity in the brain, which temporarily disrupts its normal function. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, genders, and ethnic backgrounds. It is recognized as one of the most common neurological conditions worldwide. Global health estimates show that millions of people live with epilepsy, making it a significant public health issue.
</p>

<p>
Normally, neurons in the brain communicate through carefully controlled electrical and chemical signals. This communication allows the body to perform essential functions such as movement, sensation, thinking, and behavior. In people with epilepsy, this communication system gets disrupted, resulting in sudden bursts of uncontrolled electrical activity. Depending on which part of the brain is involved, seizures can show up in various ways. These include loss of consciousness, involuntary muscle movements, sensory disturbances, altered awareness, or behavioral changes.
</p>

<p>
Epilepsy is not a single disease but a group of neurological disorders with different causes and symptoms. It may develop from genetic factors, brain injury, infections, developmental disorders, or unknown reasons. It’s important to distinguish epilepsy from a single seizure event. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when a person tends to have repeated seizures over time.
</p>

<p>
Despite common myths, epilepsy is neither contagious nor a mental illness. With early diagnosis, proper medical treatment, and lifestyle changes, many individuals with epilepsy can lead productive and independent lives. Understanding epilepsy is crucial for effective medical care and for reducing social stigma, raising awareness, and ensuring the safety and well-being of those affected.
</p>

<p>
This website aims to provide a detailed academic overview of epilepsy and seizure disorders, including their causes, types, symptoms, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and management strategies. The content is for educational purposes and seeks to improve awareness and understanding of this complex neurological condition.
</p>

<p>
Seizures occur due to sudden abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which temporarily disrupts normal brain function.
